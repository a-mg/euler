My solutions to [Project Euler][eu] problems, written as a **polyglot** project:
each problem solved (in order) in a different programming language.

  [eu]: https://projecteuler.net/

This is mainly a way for me to learn new things and try lots of different
programming languages I wouldn't otherwise have a reason to. But, I'm not too
strict; sometimes I might solve a problem multiple times, in different
languages, or use a language more than once, if I like it a lot, or want to try
it out some more.

Solutions are in `/src/`, problem data (input) in `/data/`. The `/bin/` folder
is empty but tracked in git to make a place for binary output from compilers.
(This may be rearranged in the future to one folder per problem, which would
also let me write notes in the READMEs, if I want.)

This repository also contains previous Euler attempts (Scheme, Racket), archived
in branches with respective names.
