My solutions to [Project Euler][eu] problems, written in the **polyglot** mode:
each problem solved in a different programming language.

  [eu]: https://projecteuler.net/

I like programming, and learning new things. This "project" is a means to try a
lot of programming languages I wouldn't otherwise have the chance to.

Each problem has a numbered folder, containing the solution program, any data
files, and a README with the problem description, tools (compiler/interpreter)
used, and my notes. When run, the program prints the solution to standard
output.

This repository also contains previous Euler attempts (Scheme, Racket), archived
in branches with respective names.
